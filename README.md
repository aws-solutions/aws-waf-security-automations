# Solution Overview

The AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard solution is a reference implementation that automatically deploys a set of AWS WAF (web application firewall) rules that filter common web-based attacks. Users can select from preconfigured protective features that define the rules included in an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL). Once deployed, AWS WAF protects your Amazon CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers by inspecting web requests.

You can use AWS WAF to create custom, application-specific rules that block attack patterns to ensure application availability, secure resources, and prevent excessive resource consumption.

This solution can be easily installed in your AWS accounts via launching the provided AWS CloudFormation template.

For a detailed solution implementation guide, refer to Solution Landing Page [AWS WAF Security Automations](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-waf-security-automations)

AWS WAF Security Automations architecture

AWS Managed Rules (A): This set of AWS managed core rules provides protection against exploitation of a wide range of common application vulnerabilities or other unwanted traffic.

Manual IP lists (B and C): This component creates two specific AWS WAF rules that allow you to manually insert IP addresses that you want to block or allow. You can also configure IP retention and remove expired IP addresses from these IP lists.

SQL Injection (D) and XSS (E): The solution configures two native AWS WAF rules that are designed to protect against common SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) patterns in the URI, query string, or body of a request.

HTTP flood (F): This component helps protect against attacks that consist of a large number of requests from a particular IP address, such as a web-layer DDoS attacks or a brute-force login attempt. This feature supports thresholds of less than 100 requests within a 5 minute period.

Scanners and Probes (G): This component parses application access logs searching for suspicious behavior, such as an abnormal amount of errors generated by an origin. It then blocks those suspicious source IP addresses for a customer-defined period of time.

IP Reputation Lists (H): This component is the IP Lists Parser AWS Lambda function which checks third-party IP reputation lists hourly for new ranges to block.

Bad Bots (I): This component automatically sets up a honeypot, which is a security mechanism intended to lure and deflect an attempted attack.

# Customizing the Solution

<a name="prerequisites-for-customization"></a>
## Prerequisites for Customization

* [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Python 3.8

<a name="build"></a>
## Build

Building from GitHub source will allow you to modify the solution, such as adding custom actions or upgrading to a new release. The process consists of downloading the source from GitHub, creating Amazon S3 buckets to store artifacts for deployment, building the solution, and uploading the artifacts to S3 in your account.

#### 1. Clone the repository

Clone or download the repository to a local directory on your linux client. Note: if you intend to modify the source code you may wish to create your own fork of the GitHub repo and work from that. This allows you to check in any changes you make to your private copy of the solution.

**Git Clone example:**

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-waf-security-automations.git
```

**Download Zip example:**
```
wget https://github.com/awslabs/aws-waf-security-automations/archive/master.zip
```

#### 2. Unit test
Next, run unit tests to make sure your customized code passes the tests

```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

#### 3. Create S3 buckets for storing deployment assets

AWS Solutions use two buckets:

* One global bucket that is access via the http end point. AWS CloudFormation templates are stored here. Ex. "mybucket"
* One regional bucket for each region where you plan to deploy the solution. Use the name of the global bucket as the prefix of the bucket name, and suffixed with the region name. Regional assets such as Lambda code are stored here. Ex. "mybucket-us-east-1"
* The assets in buckets must be accessible by your account

#### 4. Declare enviroment variables
```
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=<YOUR_TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET> # Name of the global bucket where CloudFormation templates are stored
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=<YOUR_DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET> # Name for the regional bucket where regional assets are stored
export SOLUTION_NAME=<SOLUTION_NAME> # name of the solution.
export VERSION=<VERSION> # version number for the customized code
export AWS_REGION=<AWS_REGION> # region where the solution is deployed
```
#### 5. Build the solution
```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh && ./build-s3-dist.sh $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

<a name="upload-deployment-assets"></a>
## Upload deployment assets
```
aws s3 cp ./deployment/global-s3-assets s3://$TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp ./deployment/regional-s3-assets s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$AWS_REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
```
#### _Note:_ You must use proper acl and profile for the copy operation as applicable. Using randomized bucket names is recommended.

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy

* From your designated Amazon S3 bucket where you uploaded the deployment assets, copy the link location for the aws-waf-security-automations.template.
* Using AWS CloudFormation, launch the AWS WAF Security Automations solution stack using the copied Amazon S3 link for the aws-waf-security-automations.template.  

When deploying the template for CloufFront, you can launch it only from `us-east-1`.

# File structure

This project consists of microservices that facilitate the functional areas of the solution. These microservices are deployed to a serverless environment in AWS Lambda.
